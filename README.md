"dependencies": {
    "angular": "^1.6.0",
    "angular-ui-router": "^0.3.2",
    "body-parser": "^1.15.2",
    "express": "^4.14.0",

    * Once file has been reviewed, launch terminal and install npm init within the project root directory. 
    * Upon successful installation, a ```node_modules``` folder will appear in the project directory.
3. Review the ```gruntfile.js``` file. Running ```grunt watch``` will clean the current build directory and create a new build  each time a file is saved.
